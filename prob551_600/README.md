Problem 551 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Square.

Assume you have access to a function `toss_biased()` which returns 0 or 1 with a probability that's not 50-50 (but also not 0-100 or 100-0). You do not know the bias of the coin.

Write a function to simulate an unbiased coin toss.

Problem 552 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Wayfair.

You are given a `2 x N` board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:

- Dominoes, or `2 x 1` rectangles.
- Trominoes, or `L`-shapes.

For example, if `N = 4`, here is one possible configuration, where `A` is a domino, and `B` and `C` are trominoes.

```
A B B C
A B C C
```

Given an integer `N`, determine in how many ways this task is possible.

Problem 553 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by M 2D matrix of lowercase letters. Determine the minimum number of columns that can be removed to ensure that each row is ordered from top to bottom lexicographically. That is, the letter at each column is lexicographically later as you go down each row. It does not matter whether each row itself is ordered lexicographically.

For example, given the following table:

```
cba
daf
ghi
```

This is not ordered because of the a in the center. We can remove the second column to make it ordered:

```
ca
df
gi
```

So your function should return 1, since we only needed to remove 1 column.

As another example, given the following table:

```
abcdef
```

Your function should return 0, since the rows are already ordered (there's only one row).

As another example, given the following table:

```
zyx
wvu
tsr
```

Your function should return 3, since we would need to remove all the columns to order it.

This problem was asked by Palantir.

The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. For example, `4 / 13` can be represented as `1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468`.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction `a / b`, where `a < b`, into an Egyptian fraction.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

An sorted array of integers was rotated an unknown number of times.

Given such an array, find the index of the element in the array in faster than linear time. If the element doesn't exist in the array, return null.

For example, given the array [13, 18, 25, 2, 8, 10] and the element 8, return 4 (the index of 8 in the array).

You can assume all the integers in the array are unique.

556 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

Given an array of integers, write a function to determine whether the array could become non-decreasing by modifying at most 1 element.

For example, given the array [10, 5, 7], you should return true, since we can modify the 10 into a 1 to make the array non-decreasing.

Given the array [10, 5, 1], you should return false, since we can't modify any one element to get a non-decreasing array.

557 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Apple.

Suppose you have a multiplication table that is N by N. That is, a 2D array where the value at the `i`-th row and `j`-th column is `(i + 1) * (j + 1)` (if 0-indexed) or `i * j` (if 1-indexed).

Given integers N and X, write a function that returns the number of times X appears as a value in an N by N multiplication table.

For example, given N = 6 and X = 12, you should return 4, since the multiplication table looks like this:

| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 |

| 2 | 4 | 6 | 8 | 10 | 12 |

| 3 | 6 | 9 | 12 | 15 | 18 |

| 4 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 20 | 24 |

| 5 | 10 | 15 | 20 | 25 | 30 |

| 6 | 12 | 18 | 24 | 30 | 36 |

And there are 4 12's in the table.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given k sorted singly linked lists, write a function to merge all the lists into one sorted singly linked list.

Problem 560 (Easy)

This problem was recently asked by Google.

Given a list of numbers and a number `k`, return whether any two numbers from the list add up to `k`.

For example, given `[10, 15, 3, 7]` and `k` of `17`, return true since `10 + 7` is `17`.

Bonus: Can you do this in one pass?

Problem 561 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Etsy.

Given a sorted array, convert it into a height-balanced binary search tree.

Problem 562 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Uber.

Given an array of integers, return a new array such that each element at index `i` of the new array is the product of all the numbers in the original array except the one at `i`.

For example, if our input was `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the expected output would be `[120, 60, 40, 30, 24]`. If our input was `[3, 2, 1]`, the expected output would be `[2, 3, 6]`.

Follow-up: what if you can't use division?

Problem 563 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Nvidia.

Find the maximum of two numbers without using any if-else statements, branching, or direct comparisons.

564 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Airbnb.

Given a list of integers, write a function that returns the largest sum of non-adjacent numbers. Numbers can be `0` or negative.

For example, `[2, 4, 6, 2, 5]` should return `13`, since we pick `2`, `6`, and `5`. `[5, 1, 1, 5]` should return `10`, since we pick `5` and `5`.

Follow-up: Can you do this in O(N) time and constant space?

565 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Pinterest.

Given an integer list where each number represents the number of hops you can make, determine whether you can reach to the last index starting at index 0.

For example, `[2, 0, 1, 0]` returns `True` while `[1, 1, 0, 1]` returns `False`.

This problem was asked by Facebook.

A graph is minimally-connected if it is connected and there is no edge that can be removed while still leaving the graph connected. For example, any binary tree is minimally-connected.

Given an undirected graph, check if the graph is minimally-connected. You can choose to represent the graph as either an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.

567 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

`cons(a, b)` constructs a pair, and `car(pair)` and `cdr(pair)` returns the first and last element of that pair. For example, `car(cons(3, 4))` returns `3`, and `cdr(cons(3, 4))` returns `4`.

Given this implementation of cons:

```
def cons(a, b):
    def pair(f):
        return f(a, b)
    return pair
```

Implement `car` and `cdr`.

Problem 568 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a sorted list of integers, square the elements and give the output in sorted order.

For example, given [-9, -2, 0, 2, 3], return [0, 4, 4, 9, 81].

Given an array of numbers of length `N`, find both the minimum and maximum using less than `2 * (N - 2)` comparisons.

Problem 570 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two non-empty binary trees `s` and `t`, check whether tree `t` has exactly the same structure and node values with a subtree of `s`. A subtree of `s` is a tree consists of a node in `s` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `s` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

Problem 571 (Medium)

The Tower of Hanoi is a puzzle game with three rods and n disks, each a different size.

All the disks start off on the first rod in a stack. They are ordered by size, with the largest disk on the bottom and the smallest one at the top.

The goal of this puzzle is to move all the disks from the first rod to the last rod while following these rules:

- You can only move one disk at a time.
- A move consists of taking the uppermost disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.
- You cannot place a larger disk on top of a smaller disk.

Write a function that prints out all the steps necessary to complete the Tower of Hanoi. You should assume that the rods are numbered, with the first rod being 1, the second (auxiliary) rod being 2, and the last (goal) rod being 3.

For example, with n = 3, we can do this in 7 moves:

```
Move 1 to 3
Move 1 to 2
Move 3 to 2
Move 1 to 3
Move 2 to 1
Move 2 to 3
Move 1 to 3
```

Problem 572 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Palantir.

Given a number represented by a list of digits, find the next greater permutation of a number, in terms of lexicographic ordering. If there is not greater permutation possible, return the permutation with the lowest value/ordering.

For example, the list `[1,2,3]` should return `[1,3,2]`. The list `[1,3,2]` should return `[2,1,3]`. The list `[3,2,1]` should return `[1,2,3]`.

Can you perform the operation without allocating extra memory (disregarding the input memory)?

Problem 573 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Google.

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

Hint: Try working backwards from the end state.

Problem 574 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Implement a bit array.

A bit array is a space efficient array that holds a value of `1` or `0` at each index.

- `init(size)`: initialize the array with `size`
- `set(i, val)`: updates index at `i` with `val` where `val` is either `1` or `0`.
- `get(i)`: gets the value at index `i`.

Problem 575 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Uber.

Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays, and should implement the following methods:

- `next()`: returns the next element in the array of arrays. If there are no more elements, raise an exception.
- `has_next()`: returns whether or not the iterator still has elements left.

For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling `next()` repeatedly should output `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Do not use `flatten` or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be empty.

Problem 576 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Spotify.

Write a function, `throw_dice(N, faces, total)`, that determines how many ways it is possible to throw `N` dice with some number of faces each to get a specific total.

For example, `throw_dice(3, 6, 7)` should equal `15`.

Problem 577 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a list of words, determine whether the words can be chained to form a circle. A word `X` can be placed in front of another word `Y` in a circle if the last character of `X` is same as the first character of `Y`.

For example, the words `['chair', 'height', 'racket', touch', 'tunic']` can form the following circle: `chair --> racket --> touch --> height --> tunic --> chair`.

Problem 578 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Bloomberg.

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string `s1` to another `s2`.

For example, given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, return `true` since we can map `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, and `c` to `d`.

Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, return `false` since the `o` cannot map to two characters.

Problem 579 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Flipkart.

Starting from 0 on a number line, you would like to make a series of jumps that lead to the integer N.

On the `i``th` jump, you may move exactly i places to the left or right.

Find a path with the fewest number of jumps required to get from 0 to N.

Problem 580 (Easy)

5    5
 \     \
   2    1
       /
     -1
```

Problem 581 (Easy)

    "dimensions": (3, 3) # width, height
}
```

and

```
{
    "top_left": (0, 5),
    "dimensions": (4, 3) # width, height

return 6.

Problem 582 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Microsoft.

Let X be a set of n intervals on the real line. We say that a set of points P "stabs" X if every interval in X contains at least one point in P. Compute the smallest set of points that stabs X.

For example, given the intervals `[(1, 4), (4, 5), (7, 9), (9, 12)]`, you should return `[4, 9]`.

Problem 583 (Medium)

This question was asked by Zillow.

You are given a 2-d `matrix` where each cell represents number of coins in that cell. Assuming we start at `matrix[0][0]`, and can only move right or down, find the maximum number of coins you can collect by the bottom right corner.

For example, in this matrix

```
0 3 1 1
2 0 0 4
1 5 3 1
```

The most we can collect is 0 + 2 + 1 + 5 + 3 + 1 = 12 coins.

Problem 584 (Easy)

This problem was asked by IBM.

Given a string with repeated characters, rearrange the string so that no two adjacent characters are the same. If this is not possible, return `None`.

For example, given "aaabbc", you could return "ababac". Given "aaab", return `None`.

Problem 585 (Medium)

This question was asked by Google.

Given an N by M matrix consisting only of 1's and 0's, find the largest rectangle containing only 1's and return its area.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[1, 0, 0, 0],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [1, 0, 1, 1],
 [0, 1, 0, 0]]
```

Return 4.

Problem 586 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Quora.

You are given a list of `(website, user)` pairs that represent users visiting websites. Come up with a program that identifies the top `k` pairs of websites with the greatest similarity.

For example, suppose `k = 1`, and the list of tuples is:

```python
[('a', 1), ('a', 3), ('a', 5),
 ('b', 2), ('b', 6),
 ('c', 1), ('c', 2), ('c', 3), ('c', 4), ('c', 5)
 ('d', 4), ('d', 5), ('d', 6), ('d', 7),
 ('e', 1), ('e', 3), ('e': 5), ('e', 6)]
```

Then a reasonable similarity metric would most likely conclude that `a` and `e` are the most similar, so your program should return `[('a', 'e')]`.

Problem 587 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Facebook.

You have a large array with most of the elements as zero.

Use a more space-efficient data structure, SparseArray, that implements the same interface:

- `init(arr, size)`: initialize with the original large array and size.
- `set(i, val)`: updates index at `i` with `val`.
- `get(i)`: gets the value at index `i`.

Problem 589 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Two Sigma.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

Problem 590 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Google.

An XOR linked list is a more memory efficient doubly linked list. Instead of each node holding `next` and `prev` fields, it holds a field named `both`, which is an XOR of the next node and the previous node. Implement an XOR linked list; it has an `add(element)` which adds the element to the end, and a `get(index)` which returns the node at index.

If using a language that has no pointers (such as Python), you can assume you have access to `get_pointer` and `dereference_pointer` functions that converts between nodes and memory addresses.

Problem 591 (Hard)

This problem was asked by Quora.

Word sense disambiguation is the problem of determining which sense a word takes on in a particular setting, if that word has multiple meanings. For example, in the sentence "I went to get money from the *bank*", bank probably means the place where people deposit money, not the land beside a river or lake.

Suppose you are given a list of meanings for several words, formatted like so:

```
{
    "word_1": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...],
    ...
    "word_n": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...]
}
```

Given a sentence, most of whose words are contained in the meaning list above, create an algorithm that determines the likely sense of each possibly ambiguous word.

Problem 592 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Given a matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

For example, this matrix has 4 islands.

```
1 0 0 0 0
0 0 1 1 0
0 1 1 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
1 1 0 0 1
1 1 0 0 1
```

Problem 593 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Mailchimp.

You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array `[3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1]`, you should return `3`, since the top floors of the buildings with heights `8`, `6`, and `1` all have an unobstructed view to the west.

Can you do this using just one forward pass through the array?

Problem 594 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Google.

You are given an N by N matrix of random letters and a dictionary of words. Find the maximum number of words that can be packed on the board from the given dictionary.

A word is considered to be able to be packed on the board if:

- It can be found in the dictionary
- It can be constructed from untaken letters by other words found so far on the board
- The letters are adjacent to each other (vertically and horizontally, not diagonally).

Each tile can be visited only once by any word.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```
{ 'eat', 'rain', 'in', 'rat' }
```

and matrix:

```
[['e', 'a', 'n'],
 ['t', 't', 'i'],
 ['a', 'r', 'a']]
```

Your function should return 3, since we can make the words 'eat', 'in', and 'rat' without them touching each other. We could have alternatively made 'eat' and 'rain', but that would be incorrect since that's only 2 words.

Problem 595 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Salesforce.

The number 6174 is known as Kaprekar's contant, after the mathematician who discovered an associated property: for all four-digit numbers with at least two distinct digits, repeatedly applying a simple procedure eventually results in this value. The procedure is as follows:

- For a given input `x`, create two new numbers that consist of the digits in `x` in ascending and descending order.
- Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

For example, this algorithm terminates in three steps when starting from `1234`:

- `4321 - 1234 = 3087`
- `8730 - 0378 = 8352`
- `8532 - 2358 = 6174`

Write a function that returns how many steps this will take for a given input `N`.

Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a word. The first person who spells out a word, or creates a prefix for which there is no possible continuation, loses. Here is a sample game:

- Player 1: `g`
- Player 2: `h`
- Player 1: `o`
- Player 2: `s`
- Player 1: `t` [loses]

Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is `["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"]`, the only winning start letter would be `b`.
