Problem 551 (Medium)

This problem was asked by Square.

Assume you have access to a function `toss_biased()` which returns 0 or 1 with a probability that's not 50-50 (but also not 0-100 or 100-0). You do not know the bias of the coin.

Write a function to simulate an unbiased coin toss.

Problem 552 (Easy)

This problem was asked by Wayfair.

You are given a `2 x N` board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:

- Dominoes, or `2 x 1` rectangles.
- Trominoes, or `L`-shapes.

For example, if `N = 4`, here is one possible configuration, where `A` is a domino, and `B` and `C` are trominoes.

```
A B B C
A B C C
```

Given an integer `N`, determine in how many ways this task is possible.
