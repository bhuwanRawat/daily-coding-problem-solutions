Let's represent an integer in a linked list format by having each node represent a digit in the number. The nodes make up the number in reversed order.

For example, the following linked list:

```
1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5
```

is the number 54321.

Given two linked lists in this format, return their sum in the same linked list format.

For example, given

```
9 -> 9
5 -> 2
```

return 124 (99 + 25) as:

```
4 -> 2 -> 1
```

Given the root of a binary search tree, and a target `K`, return two nodes in the tree whose sum equals `K`.

For example, given the following tree and `K` of 20

```
    10
   /   \
 5      15
       /  \
     11    15
```

Return the nodes `5` and `15`.

Conway's Game of Life takes place on an infinite two-dimensional board of square cells. Each cell is either dead or alive, and at each tick, the following rules apply:

- Any live cell with less than two live neighbours dies.
- Any live cell with two or three live neighbours remains living.
- Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies.
- Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.

A cell neighbours another cell if it is horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent.

Implement Conway's Game of Life. It should be able to be initialized with a starting list of live cell coordinates and the number of steps it should run for. Once initialized, it should print out the board state at each step. Since it's an infinite board, print out only the relevant coordinates, i.e. from the top-leftmost live cell to bottom-rightmost live cell.

You can represent a live cell with an asterisk (`*`) and a dead cell with a dot (`.`).

You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of groups of people into a building. An entry looks like this:

```
{"timestamp": 1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"}
```

This means 3 people entered the building. An exit looks like this:

```
{"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2, "type": "exit"}
```

This means that 2 people exited the building. `timestamp` is in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

Find the busiest period in the building, that is, the time with the most people in the building. Return it as a pair of `(start, end)` timestamps. You can assume the building always starts off and ends up empty, i.e. with 0 people inside.

Given a word W and a string `S`, find all starting indices in `S` which are anagrams of `W`.

For example, given that W is "ab", and S is "abxaba", return 0, 3, and 4.

A rule looks like this:

```
A NE B
```

This means this means point `A` is located northeast of point `B`.

```
A SW C
```

means that point `A` is southwest of `C`.

Given a list of rules, check if the sum of the rules validate. For example:

```
A N B
B NE C
C N A
```

does not validate, since `A` cannot be both north and south of `C`.

```
A NW B
A N B
```

is considered valid.

Write a program that determines the smallest number of perfect squares that sum up to `N`.

Here are a few examples:

- Given `N = 4`, return `1` (4)
- Given `N = 17`, return `2` (16 + 1)
- Given `N = 18`, return `2` (9 + 9)

You are given a string consisting of the letters `x` and `y`, such as `xyxxxyxyy`. In addition, you have an operation called `flip`, which changes a single `x` to `y` or vice versa.

Determine how many times you would need to apply this operation to ensure that all `x`'s come before all `y`'s. In the preceding example, it suffices to flip the second and sixth characters, so you should return `2`.

There is an N by M matrix of zeroes. Given N and M, write a function to count the number of ways of starting at the top-left corner and getting to the bottom-right corner. You can only move right or down.

For example, given a 2 by 2 matrix, you should return 2, since there are two ways to get to the bottom-right:

- Right, then down
- Down, then right

Given a 5 by 5 matrix, there are 70 ways to get to the bottom-right.

We say a number is sparse if there are no adjacent ones in its binary representation. For example, `21` (10101) is sparse, but `22` (10110) is not. For a given input `N`, find the smallest sparse number greater than or equal to `N`.

Do this in faster than `O(N log N)` time.

On a mysterious island there are creatures known as Quxes which come in three colors: red, green, and blue. One power of the Qux is that if two of them are standing next to each other, they can transform into a single creature of the third color.

Given `N` Quxes standing in a line, determine the smallest number of them remaining after any possible sequence of such transformations.

For example, given the input `['R', 'G', 'B', 'G', 'B']`, it is possible to end up with a single Qux through the following steps:

```
        Arrangement       |   Change
----------------------------------------
['R', 'G', 'B', 'G', 'B'] | (R, G) -> B
['B', 'B', 'G', 'B']      | (B, G) -> R
['B', 'R', 'B']           | (R, B) -> G
['B', 'G']                | (B, G) -> R
['R']                     |
```
