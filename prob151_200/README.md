For example, given the following matrix, and location pixel of (2, 2), and 'G' for green:

```
B B W
W W W
W W W
B B B
```

Becomes

```
B B G
G G G
G G G
B B B
```

This problem was asked by Triplebyte.

You are given `n` numbers as well as `n` probabilities that sum up to 1. Write a function to generate one of the numbers with its corresponding probability.

For example, given the numbers `[1, 2, 3, 4]` and probabilities `[0.1, 0.5, 0.2, 0.2]`, your function should return `1` 10% of the time, `2` 50% of the time, and 3 and 4 20% of the time.

You can generate random numbers between 0 and 1 uniformly.

Find an efficient algorithm to find the smallest distance (measured in number of words) between any two given words in a string.

For example, given words "hello", and "world" and a text content of "dog cat hello cat dog dog hello cat world", return 1 because there's only one word "cat" in between the two words.

Implement a stack API using only a heap. A stack implements the following methods:

- `push(item)`, which adds an element to the stack
- `pop()`, which removes and returns the most recently added element (or throws an error if there is nothing on the stack)

Recall that a heap has the following operations:

- `push(item)`, which adds a new key to the heap
- `pop()`, which removes and returns the max value of the heap

Given a list of elements, find the majority element, which appears more than half the time (`> floor(len(lst) / 2.0)`).

Given a positive integer `n`, find the smallest number of squared integers which sum to `n`.

For example, given `n` = 13, return 2 since 13 = 3^2 + 2^2 = 9 + 4.

Given `n` = 27, return 3 since 27 = 3^2 + 3^2 + 3^2 = 9 + 9 + 9.

Given a string, determine whether any permutation of it is a palindrome.

For example, `carrace` should return true, since it can be rearranged to form `racecar`, which is a palindrome. `daily` should return false, since there's no rearrangement that can form a palindrome.

This problem was asked by Slack.

You are given an N by M matrix of `0`s and `1`s. Starting from the top left corner, how many ways are there to reach the bottom right corner?

You can only move right and down. `0` represents an empty space while `1` represents a wall you cannot walk through.

For example, given the following matrix:

```
[[0, 0, 1],
 [0, 0, 1],
 [1, 0, 0]]
```

Return two, as there are only two ways to get to the bottom right:

- Right, down, down, right
- Down, right, down, right

The top left corner and bottom right corner will always be `0`.

Given a tree where each edge has a weight, compute the length of the longest path in the tree.

For example, given the following tree:

```
   a
  /|\
 b c d

   e   f
  / \
 g   h
```

and the weights: `a-b: 3, a-c: 5, a-d: 8, d-e: 2, d-f: 4, e-g: 1, e-h: 1`, the longest path would be `c -> a -> d -> f`, with a length of 17.

The path does not have to pass through the root, and each node can have any amount of children.

This problem was asked by Jane Street.

Given an arithmetic expression in [Reverse Polish Notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_Polish_notation), write a program to evaluate it.

The expression is given as a list of numbers and operands. For example: `[5, 3, '+']` should return `5 + 3 = 8`.

For example, `[15, 7, 1, 1, '+', '-', '/', 3, '*', 2, 1, 1, '+', '+', '-']`should return `5`, since it is equivalent to ((15 / (7 - (1 + 1))) * 3) - (2 + (1 + 1)) = 5.

You can assume the given expression is always valid.

Given an array of integers, return a new array where each element in the new array is the number of smaller elements to the right of that element in the original input array.

For example, given the array `[3, 4, 9, 6, 1]`, return `[1, 1, 2, 1, 0]`, since:

- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 3
- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 4
- There are 2 smaller elements to the right of 9
- There is 1 smaller element to the right of 6
- There are no smaller elements to the right of 1

Implement a 2D iterator class. It will be initialized with an array of arrays, and should implement the following methods:

- `next()`: returns the next element in the array of arrays. If there are no more elements, raise an exception.
- `has_next()`: returns whether or not the iterator still has elements left.

For example, given the input [[1, 2], [3], [], [4, 5, 6]], calling `next()` repeatedly should output `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6`.

Do not use `flatten` or otherwise clone the arrays. Some of the arrays can be empty.

Given a `start` word, an `end` word, and a dictionary of valid words, find the shortest transformation sequence from `start` to `end` such that only one letter is changed at each step of the sequence, and each transformed word exists in the dictionary. If there is no possible transformation, return null. Each word in the dictionary have the same length as `start` and `end`and is lowercase.

For example, given `start = "dog"`, `end = "cat"`, and `dictionary = {"dot", "dop", "dat", "cat"}`, return `["dog", "dot", "dat", "cat"]`.

Given `start = "dog"`, `end = "cat"`, and `dictionary = {"dot", "tod", "dat", "dar"}`, return null as there is no possible transformation from `dog` to `cat`.

You are given a list of data entries that represent entries and exits of groups of people into a building. An entry looks like this:

```
{"timestamp": 1526579928, count: 3, "type": "enter"}
```

This means 3 people entered the building. An exit looks like this:

```
{"timestamp": 1526580382, count: 2, "type": "exit"}
```

This means that 2 people exited the building. `timestamp` is in [Unix time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_time).

Find the busiest period in the building, that is, the time with the most people in the building. Return it as a pair of `(start, end)` timestamps. You can assume the building always starts off and ends up empty, i.e. with 0 people inside.

This problem was asked by Dropbox.

Given a string `s` and a list of words `words`, where each word is the same length, find all starting indices of substrings in `s` that is a concatenation of every word in `words` exactly once.

For example, given s = "dogcatcatcodecatdog" and words = ["cat", "dog"], return [0, 13], since "dogcat" starts at index 0 and "catdog" starts at index 13.

Given s = "barfoobazbitbyte" and words = ["dog", "cat"], return [] since there are no substrings composed of "dog" and "cat" in `s`.

The order of the indices does not matter.

Write a function to flatten a nested dictionary. Namespace the keys with a period.

For example, given the following dictionary:

```
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo": {
        "a": 5,
        "bar": {
            "baz": 8
        }
    }
}
```

it should become:

```
{
    "key": 3,
    "foo.a": 5,
    "foo.bar.baz": 8
}
```

You can assume keys do not contain dots in them, i.e. no clobbering will occur.

You are given a starting state start, a list of transition probabilities for a Markov chain, and a number of steps num_steps. Run the Markov chain starting from start for num_steps and compute the number of times we visited each state.

For example, given the starting state a, number of steps 5000, and the following transition probabilities:

('a', 'b', 0.075),
('a', 'c', 0.025),

('b', 'c', 0.05),
('c', 'a', 0.25),
('c', 'b', 0.25),

Determine whether there exists a one-to-one character mapping from one string `s1` to another `s2`.

For example, given `s1 = abc` and `s2 = bcd`, return `true` since we can map `a` to `b`, `b` to `c`, and `c` to `d`.

Given `s1 = foo` and `s2 = bar`, return `false` since the `o` cannot map to two characters.

Alice wants to join her school's Probability Student Club. Membership dues are computed via one of two simple probabilistic games.

The first game: roll a die repeatedly. Stop rolling once you get a five followed by a six. Your number of rolls is the amount you pay, in dollars.

The second game: same, except that the stopping condition is a five followed by a five.

Which of the two games should Alice elect to play? Does it even matter? Write a program to simulate the two games and calculate their expected value.

Given a stack of N elements, interleave the first half of the stack with the second half reversed using only one other queue. This should be done in-place.

Recall that you can only push or pop from a stack, and enqueue or dequeue from a queue.

For example, if the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], it should become [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]. If the stack is [1, 2, 3, 4], it should become [1, 4, 2, 3].

You are given an array of nonnegative integers. Let's say you start at the beginning of the array and are trying to advance to the end. You can advance at most, the number of steps that you're currently on. Determine whether you can get to the end of the array.

For example, given the array `[1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1]`, we can go from indices `0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5`, so return `true`.

Given the array `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`, we can't reach the end, so return `false`.
