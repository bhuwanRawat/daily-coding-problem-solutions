The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. For example, `4 / 13` can be represented as `1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468`.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction `a / b`, where `a < b`, into an Egyptian fraction.

Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k``th` line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:

```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```

Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.

For example, given the following tree:

```
         0
      /     \
    1         2
  /            \
3                 4
  \             /   \
    5          6     7
```

You should convert it to:

```
     0
  /     \
5         4
        /   \
       6     7
```

The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix `M`, where `M[i][j] == 1` if there is a path between vertices `i` and `j`, and otherwise `0`.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

```
graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
```

The transitive closure of this graph would be:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Given a graph, find its transitive closure.

Given a linked list, rearrange the node values such that they appear in alternating `low -> high -> low -> high ...` form. For example, given `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, you should return `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4`.

In Ancient Greece, it was common to write text with the first line going left to right, the second line going right to left, and continuing to go back and forth. This style was called "boustrophedon".

Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to print the nodes in boustrophedon order.

For example, given the following tree:

```
       1
    /     \
  2         3
 / \       / \
4   5     6   7
```

You should return `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a word. The first person who spells out a word, or creates a prefix for which there is no possible continuation, loses. Here is a sample game:

- Player 1: `g`
- Player 2: `h`
- Player 1: `o`
- Player 2: `s`
- Player 1: `t` [loses]

Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is `["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"]`, the only winning start letter would be `b`.

The sequence `[0, 1, ..., N]` has been jumbled, and the only clue you have for its order is an array representing whether each number is larger or smaller than the last. Given this information, reconstruct an array that is consistent with it. For example, given `[None, +, +, -, +]`, you could return `[1, 2, 3, 0, 4]`.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as `0101` or `111110`, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a `0` in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to `1`.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
```

With this encoding, `cats` would be represented as `0000110111`.

Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.

Create a basic sentence checker that takes in a stream of characters and determines whether they form valid sentences. If a sentence is valid, the program should print it out.

We can consider a sentence valid if it conforms to the following rules:

1. The sentence must start with a capital letter, followed by a lowercase letter or a space.
2. All other characters must be lowercase letters, separators (`,`,`;`,`:`) or terminal marks (`.`,`?`,`!`,`â€½`).
3. There must be a single space between each word.
4. The sentence must end with a terminal mark immediately following a word.

Given a set of characters `C` and an integer `k`, a De Bruijn sequence is a cyclic sequence in which every possible `k`-length string of characters in `C` occurs exactly once.

For example, suppose `C = {0, 1}` and `k = 3`. Then our sequence should contain the substrings `{'000', '001', '010', '011', '100', '101', '110', '111'}`, and one possible solution would be `00010111`.

Create an algorithm that finds a De Bruijn sequence.

MegaCorp wants to give bonuses to its employees based on how many lines of codes they have written. They would like to give the smallest positive amount to each worker consistent with the constraint that if a developer has written more lines of code than their neighbor, they should receive more money.

Given an array representing a line of seats of employees at MegaCorp, determine how much each one should get paid.

For example, given `[10, 40, 200, 1000, 60, 30]`, you should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]`.

A step word is formed by taking a given word, adding a letter, and anagramming the result. For example, starting with the word "APPLE", you can add an "A" and anagram to get "APPEAL".

You are presented with an `8` by `8` matrix representing the positions of pieces on a chess board. The only pieces on the board are the black king and various white pieces. Given this matrix, determine whether the king is in check.

For details on how each piece moves, see [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess_piece#Moves_of_the_pieces).

For example, given the following matrix:

```python
...K....
........
.B......
......P.
.......R
..N.....
........
.....Q..
```

You should return `True`, since the bishop is attacking the king diagonally.

You are given an string representing the initial conditions of some dominoes. Each element can take one of three values:

- `L`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the left,
- `R`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the right, or
- `.`, meaning the domino is standing still.

Determine the orientation of each tile when the dominoes stop falling. Note that if a domino receives a force from the left and right side simultaneously, it will remain upright.

For example, given the string `.L.R....L`, you should return `LL.RRRLLL`.

Given the string `..R...L.L`, you should return `..RR.LLLL`.

A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `N`. You are given a list of edges `(a, b, t)`, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b`. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node, if possible.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`.

For example, given `N = 5`, and the following edges:

```
edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
```

You should return `9`, because propagating the message from `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` will take that much time.

The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term `1`, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows:

```
1
11
21
1211
111221
```

As an example, the fourth term is `1211`, since the third term consists of one `2` and one `1`.

Given an integer `N`, print the `N`th term of this sequence.
