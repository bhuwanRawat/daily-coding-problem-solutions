The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. For example, `4 / 13` can be represented as `1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468`.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction `a / b`, where `a < b`, into an Egyptian fraction.

Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k``th` line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:

```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```

Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.

For example, given the following tree:

```
         0
      /     \
    1         2
  /            \
3                 4
  \             /   \
    5          6     7
```

You should convert it to:

```
     0
  /     \
5         4
        /   \
       6     7
```
