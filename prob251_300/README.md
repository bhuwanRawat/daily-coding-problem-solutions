Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.

For example, given the following tree:

```
         0
      /     \
    1         2
  /            \
3                 4
  \             /   \
    5          6     7
```

You should convert it to:

```
     0
  /     \
5         4
        /   \
       6     7

The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix `M`, where `M[i][j] == 1` if there is a path between vertices `i` and `j`, and otherwise `0`.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

```
graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
```

The transitive closure of this graph would be:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Given a graph, find its transitive closure.

Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a word. The first person who spells out a word, or creates a prefix for which there is no possible continuation, loses. Here is a sample game:

- Player 1: `g`
- Player 2: `h`
- Player 1: `o`
- Player 2: `s`
- Player 1: `t` [loses]

Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is `["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"]`, the only winning start letter would be `b`.

Huffman coding is a method of encoding characters based on their frequency. Each letter is assigned a variable-length binary string, such as `0101` or `111110`, where shorter lengths correspond to more common letters. To accomplish this, a binary tree is built such that the path from the root to any leaf uniquely maps to a character. When traversing the path, descending to a left child corresponds to a `0` in the prefix, while descending right corresponds to `1`.

Here is an example tree (note that only the leaf nodes have letters):

```
        *
      /   \
    *       *
   / \     / \
  *   a   t   *
 /             \
c               s
```

With this encoding, `cats` would be represented as `0000110111`.

Given a dictionary of character frequencies, build a Huffman tree, and use it to determine a mapping between characters and their encoded binary strings.

You are given an string representing the initial conditions of some dominoes. Each element can take one of three values:

- `L`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the left,
- `R`, meaning the domino has just been pushed to the right, or
- `.`, meaning the domino is standing still.

Determine the orientation of each tile when the dominoes stop falling. Note that if a domino receives a force from the left and right side simultaneously, it will remain upright.

For example, given the string `.L.R....L`, you should return `LL.RRRLLL`.

Given the string `..R...L.L`, you should return `..RR.LLLL`.

This problem was asked by Twitter.

A network consists of nodes labeled `0` to `N`. You are given a list of edges `(a, b, t)`, describing the time `t` it takes for a message to be sent from node `a` to node `b`. Whenever a node receives a message, it immediately passes the message on to a neighboring node, if possible.

Assuming all nodes are connected, determine how long it will take for every node to receive a message that begins at node `0`.

For example, given `N = 5`, and the following edges:

```
edges = [
    (0, 1, 5),
    (0, 2, 3),
    (0, 5, 4),
    (1, 3, 8),
    (2, 3, 1),
    (3, 5, 10),
    (3, 4, 5)
]
```

You should return `9`, because propagating the message from `0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4` will take that much time.

UTF-8 is a character encoding that maps each symbol to one, two, three, or four bytes.

For example, the Euro sign, â‚¬, corresponds to the three bytes `11100010 10000010 10101100`. The rules for mapping characters are as follows:

- For a single-byte character, the first bit must be zero.
- For an `n`-byte character, the first byte starts with `n` ones and a zero. The other `n - 1` bytes all start with `10`.

Visually, this can be represented as follows.

```
 Bytes   |           Byte format
-----------------------------------------------
   1     | 0xxxxxxx
   2     | 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
   3     | 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
   4     | 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

A classroom consists of `N` students, whose friendships can be represented in an adjacency list. For example, the following descibes a situation where `0` is friends with `1` and `2`, `3` is friends with `6`, and so on.

```python
{0: [1, 2],
 1: [0, 5],
 2: [0],
 3: [6],
 4: [],
 5: [1],
 6: [3]} 
```

Each student can be placed in a friend group, which can be defined as the transitive closure of that student's friendship relations. In other words, this is the smallest set such that no student in the group has any friends outside this group. For the example above, the friend groups would be `{0, 1, 2, 5}, {3, 6}, {4}`.

Given a friendship list such as the one above, determine the number of friend groups in the class.

A wall consists of several rows of bricks of various integer lengths and uniform height. Your goal is to find a vertical line going from the top to the bottom of the wall that cuts through the fewest number of bricks. If the line goes through the edge between two bricks, this does not count as a cut.

For example, suppose the input is as follows, where values in each row represent the lengths of bricks in that row:

```python
[[3, 5, 1, 1],
 [2, 3, 3, 2],
 [5, 5],
 [4, 4, 2],
 [1, 3, 3, 3],
 [1, 1, 6, 1, 1]]
```

The best we can we do here is to draw a line after the eighth brick, which will only require cutting through the bricks in the third and fifth row.

Given an input consisting of brick lengths for each row such as the one above, return the fewest number of bricks that must be cut to create a vertical line.

You are given an array representing the heights of neighboring buildings on a city street, from east to west. The city assessor would like you to write an algorithm that returns how many of these buildings have a view of the setting sun, in order to properly value the street.

For example, given the array `[3, 7, 8, 3, 6, 1]`, you should return `3`, since the top floors of the buildings with heights `8`, `6`, and `1` all have an unobstructed view to the west.

This problem was asked by VMware.

The skyline of a city is composed of several buildings of various widths and heights, possibly overlapping one another when viewed from a distance. We can represent the buildings using an array of `(left, right, height)` tuples, which tell us where on an imaginary x-axis a building begins and ends, and how tall it is. The skyline itself can be described by a list of `(x, height)` tuples, giving the locations at which the height visible to a distant observer changes, and each new height.

Given an array of buildings as described above, create a function that returns the skyline.

For example, suppose the input consists of the buildings `[(0, 15, 3), (4, 11, 5), (19, 23, 4)]`. In aggregate, these buildings would create a skyline that looks like the one below.

```
     ______  
    |      |        ___
 ___|      |___    |   | 
|   |   B  |   |   | C |
| A |      | A |   |   |
|   |      |   |   |   |
------------------------

As a result, your function should return `[(0, 3), (4, 5), (11, 3), (15, 0), (19, 4), (23, 0)]`.

[('a', 1), ('a', 3), ('a', 5),

 ('d', 4), ('d', 5), ('d', 6), ('d', 7),
 ('e', 1), ('e', 3), ('e': 5), ('e', 6)]
```

Then a reasonable similarity metric would most likely conclude that `a` and `e` are the most similar, so your program should return `[('a', 'e')]`.

The number 6174 is known as Kaprekar's contant, after the mathematician who discovered an associated property: for all four-digit numbers with at least two distinct digits, repeatedly applying a simple procedure eventually results in this value. The procedure is as follows:

- For a given input `x`, create two new numbers that consist of the digits in `x` in ascending and descending order.
- Subtract the smaller number from the larger number.

For example, this algorithm terminates in three steps when starting from `1234`:

- `4321 - 1234 = 3087`
- `8730 - 0378 = 8352`
- `8532 - 2358 = 6174`

The game of Nim is played as follows. Starting with three heaps, each containing a variable number of items, two players take turns removing one or more items from a single pile. The player who eventually is forced to take the last stone loses. For example, if the initial heap sizes are `3`, `4`, and `5`, a game could be played as shown below:

```
  A  |  B  |  C

  3  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  3
  0  |  1  |  0
  0  |  0  |  0

You have `N` stones in a row, and would like to create from them a pyramid. This pyramid should be constructed such that the height of each stone increases by one until reaching the tallest stone, after which the heights decrease by one. In addition, the start and end stones of the pyramid should each be one stone high.

You can change the height of any stone by paying a cost of `1` unit to lower its height by `1`, as many times as necessary. Given this information, determine the lowest cost method to produce this pyramid.

For example, given the stones `[1, 1, 3, 3, 2, 1]`, the optimal solution is to pay `2` to create `[0, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`.

A competitive runner would like to create a route that starts and ends at his house, with the condition that the route goes entirely uphill at first, and then entirely downhill.

Given a dictionary of places of the form `{location: elevation}`, and a dictionary mapping paths between some of these locations to their corresponding distances, find the length of the shortest route satisfying the condition above. Assume the runner's home is location `0`.

For example, suppose you are given the following input:

```python
elevations = {0: 5, 1: 25, 2: 15, 3: 20, 4: 10}
paths = {
    (0, 1): 10,
    (0, 2): 8,
    (0, 3): 15,

    (2, 4): 10,
    (3, 4): 5,
    (3, 0): 17,
    (4, 0): 10

```

In this case, the shortest valid path would be `0 -> 2 -> 4 -> 0`, with a distance of `28`.
