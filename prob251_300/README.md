The ancient Egyptians used to express fractions as a sum of several terms where each numerator is one. For example, `4 / 13` can be represented as `1 / 4 + 1 / 18 + 1 / 468`.

Create an algorithm to turn an ordinary fraction `a / b`, where `a < b`, into an Egyptian fraction.

Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k``th` line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:

```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```

Recall that a full binary tree is one in which each node is either a leaf node, or has two children. Given a binary tree, convert it to a full one by removing nodes with only one child.

For example, given the following tree:

```
         0
      /     \
    1         2
  /            \
3                 4
  \             /   \
    5          6     7
```

You should convert it to:

```
     0
  /     \
5         4
        /   \
       6     7
```

The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix `M`, where `M[i][j] == 1` if there is a path between vertices `i` and `j`, and otherwise `0`.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

```
graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
```

The transitive closure of this graph would be:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Given a graph, find its transitive closure.

Given a linked list, rearrange the node values such that they appear in alternating `low -> high -> low -> high ...` form. For example, given `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, you should return `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4`.

Given an array of integers out of order, determine the bounds of the smallest window that must be sorted in order for the entire array to be sorted. For example, given `[3, 7, 5, 6, 9]`, you should return `(1, 3)`.

In Ancient Greece, it was common to write text with the first line going left to right, the second line going right to left, and continuing to go back and forth. This style was called "boustrophedon".

Given a binary tree, write an algorithm to print the nodes in boustrophedon order.

For example, given the following tree:

```
       1
    /     \
  2         3
 / \       / \
4   5     6   7
```

You should return `[1, 3, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Ghost is a two-person word game where players alternate appending letters to a word. The first person who spells out a word, or creates a prefix for which there is no possible continuation, loses. Here is a sample game:

- Player 1: `g`
- Player 2: `h`
- Player 1: `o`
- Player 2: `s`
- Player 1: `t` [loses]

Given a dictionary of words, determine the letters the first player should start with, such that with optimal play they cannot lose.

For example, if the dictionary is `["cat", "calf", "dog", "bear"]`, the only winning start letter would be `b`.
