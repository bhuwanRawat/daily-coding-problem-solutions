A permutation can be specified by an array `P`, where `P[i]` represents the location of the element at `i` in the permutation. For example, `[2, 1, 0]` represents the permutation where elements at the index `0` and `2` are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. For example, given the array `["a", "b", "c"]` and the permutation `[2, 1, 0]`, return `["c", "b", "a"]`.

This problem was asked by Quantcast.

You are presented with an array representing a Boolean expression. The elements are of two kinds:

- `T` and `F`, representing the values `True` and `False`.
- `&`, `|`, and `^`, representing the bitwise operators for `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR`.

Determine the number of ways to group the array elements using parentheses so that the entire expression evaluates to `True`.

For example, suppose the input is `['F', '|', 'T', '&', 'T']`. In this case, there are two acceptable groupings: `(F | T) & T` and `F | (T & T)`.

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are houses, and arrows represent pipes:

```
A <--> B <--> C <--> plant
```

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from `plant` to `A`, `plant` to `B`, and `B` to `C`, for a total cost of `16`.

```
pipes = {
    'plant': {'A': 1, 'B': 5, 'C': 20},
    'A': {'C': 15},
    'B': {'C': 10},
    'C': {}
}
```

Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer `k`, return the maximum profit you can make from `k` buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

For example, given `k` = 2 and the array `[5, 2, 4, 0, 1]`, you should return 3.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are `N` sites, and each site `i` has a certain count `C``i` of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site `S``j` is defined as :

```
score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))
```

Here, `S``x`, `S``y`, `...`, `S``z` denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to `S``j`, and `d` is a damping factor, usually set to around `0.85`, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.

You are given an array `X` of floating-point numbers `x``1`, `x``2`, ... `x``n`. These can be rounded up or down to create a corresponding array `Y` of integers `y``1`, `y``2`, ... `y``n`.

Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate `Y` array with the following properties:

- The rounded sums of both arrays should be equal.
- The absolute pairwise difference between elements is minimized. In other words, `|x``1``- y``1``| + |x``2``- y``2``| + ... + |x``n``- y``n``|` should be as small as possible.

For example, suppose your input is `[1.3, 2.3, 4.4]`. In this case you cannot do better than `[1, 2, 5]`, which has an absolute difference of `|1.3 - 1| + |2.3 - 2| + |4.4 - 5| = 1`.

The "look and say" sequence is defined as follows: beginning with the term `1`, each subsequent term visually describes the digits appearing in the previous term. The first few terms are as follows:

```
1
11
21
1211
111221
```

As an example, the fourth term is `1211`, since the third term consists of one `2` and one `1`.

Given an integer `N`, print the `N`th term of this sequence.

There exists a staircase with N steps, and you can climb up either 1 or 2 steps at a time. Given N, write a function that returns the number of unique ways you can climb the staircase. The order of the steps matters.

For example, if N is 4, then there are 5 unique ways:

- 1, 1, 1, 1
- 2, 1, 1
- 1, 2, 1
- 1, 1, 2
- 2, 2

What if, instead of being able to climb 1 or 2 steps at a time, you could climb any number from a set of positive integers X? For example, if X = {1, 3, 5}, you could climb 1, 3, or 5 steps at a time.

Given a array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you could have made from buying and selling that stock. You're also given a number `fee` that represents a transaction fee for each buy and sell transaction.

You must buy before you can sell the stock, but you can make as many transactions as you like.

For example, given [1, 3, 2, 8, 4, 10] and `fee = 2`, you should return 9, since you could buy the stock at 1 dollar, and sell at 8 dollars, and then buy it at 4 dollars and sell it at 10 dollars. Since we did two transactions, there is a 4 dollar fee, so we have 7 + 6 = 13 profit minus 4 dollars of fees.

You are in an infinite 2D grid where you can move in any of the 8 directions:

```
 (x,y) to
    (x+1, y),
    (x - 1, y),
    (x, y+1),
    (x, y-1),
    (x-1, y-1),
    (x+1,y+1),
    (x-1,y+1),
    (x+1,y-1)
```

You are given a sequence of points and the order in which you need to cover the points. Give the minimum number of steps in which you can achieve it. You start from the first point.

Example:

```
Input: [(0, 0), (1, 1), (1, 2)]
Output: 2
```

It takes 1 step to move from `(0, 0)` to `(1, 1)`. It takes one more step to move from `(1, 1)` to `(1, 2)`.

Given a linked list, remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. Print out the remaining nodes.

For example, suppose you are given the input `3 -> 4 -> -7 -> 5 -> -6 -> 6`. In this case, you should first remove `3 -> 4 -> -7`, then `-6 -> 6`, leaving only `5`.

MegaCorp wants to give bonuses to its employees based on how many lines of codes they have written. They would like to give the smallest positive amount to each worker consistent with the constraint that if a developer has written more lines of code than their neighbor, they should receive more money.

Given an array representing a line of seats of employees at MegaCorp, determine how much each one should get paid.

For example, given `[10, 40, 200, 1000, 60, 30]`, you should return `[1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 1]`.

Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:

- You may decrement `N` to `N - 1`.
- If `a * b = N`, you may decrement `N` to the larger of `a` and `b`.

For example, given `100`, you can reach `1` in five steps with the following route: `100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

The transitive closure of a graph is a measure of which vertices are reachable from other vertices. It can be represented as a matrix `M`, where `M[i][j] == 1` if there is a path between vertices `i` and `j`, and otherwise `0`.

For example, suppose we are given the following graph in adjacency list form:

```
graph = [
    [0, 1, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [2],
    [3]
]
```

The transitive closure of this graph would be:

```
[1, 1, 1, 1]
[0, 1, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 1, 0]
[0, 0, 0, 1]
```

Given a graph, find its transitive closure.
