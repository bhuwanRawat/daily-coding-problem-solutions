A permutation can be specified by an array `P`, where `P[i]` represents the location of the element at `i` in the permutation. For example, `[2, 1, 0]` represents the permutation where elements at the index `0` and `2` are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. For example, given the array `["a", "b", "c"]` and the permutation `[2, 1, 0]`, return `["c", "b", "a"]`.

A strobogrammatic number is a positive number that appears the same after being rotated 180 degrees. For example, `16891` is strobogrammatic.

Create a program that finds all strobogrammatic numbers with `N` digits.

Given an array of time intervals (start, end) for classroom lectures (possibly overlapping), find the minimum number of rooms required.

For example, given [(30, 75), (0, 50), (60, 150)], you should return 2.

You are presented with an array representing a Boolean expression. The elements are of two kinds:

- `T` and `F`, representing the values `True` and `False`.
- `&`, `|`, and `^`, representing the bitwise operators for `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR`.

Determine the number of ways to group the array elements using parentheses so that the entire expression evaluates to `True`.

For example, suppose the input is `['F', '|', 'T', '&', 'T']`. In this case, there are two acceptable groupings: `(F | T) & T` and `F | (T & T)`.

A group of houses is connected to the main water plant by means of a set of pipes. A house can either be connected by a set of pipes extending directly to the plant, or indirectly by a pipe to a nearby house which is otherwise connected.

For example, here is a possible configuration, where `A`, `B`, and `C` are houses, and arrows represent pipes:

```
A <--> B <--> C <--> plant
```

Each pipe has an associated cost, which the utility company would like to minimize. Given an undirected graph of pipe connections, return the lowest cost configuration of pipes such that each house has access to water.

In the following setup, for example, we can remove all but the pipes from `plant` to `A`, `plant` to `B`, and `B` to `C`, for a total cost of `16`.

```
pipes = {
    'plant': {'A': 1, 'B': 5, 'C': 20},
    'A': {'C': 15},
    'B': {'C': 10},
    'C': {}
}
```

Given an array of numbers representing the stock prices of a company in chronological order and an integer `k`, return the maximum profit you can make from `k` buys and sells. You must buy the stock before you can sell it, and you must sell the stock before you can buy it again.

For example, given `k` = 2 and the array `[5, 2, 4, 0, 1]`, you should return 3.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are `N` sites, and each site `i` has a certain count `C``i` of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site `S``j` is defined as :

```
score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))
```

Here, `S``x`, `S``y`, `...`, `S``z` denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to `S``j`, and `d` is a damping factor, usually set to around `0.85`, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.
