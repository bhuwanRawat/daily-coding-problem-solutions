Given a function that generates perfectly random numbers between 1 and k (inclusive), where k is an input, write a function that shuffles a deck of cards represented as an array using only swaps.

It should run in O(N) time.

Hint: Make sure each one of the 52! permutations of the deck is equally likely.

Given a linked list, sort it in O(n log n) time and constant space.

For example, the linked list `4 -> 1 -> -3 -> 99` should become `-3 -> 1 -> 4 -> 99`.

You run an e-commerce website and want to record the last `N` `order` ids in a log. Implement a data structure to accomplish this, with the following API:

- record(order_id): adds the order_id to the log
- get_last(i): gets the ith last element from the log. i is guaranteed to be smaller than or equal to N.

You should be as efficient with time and space as possible.

Given a linked list, rearrange the node values such that they appear in alternating `low -> high -> low -> high ...` form. For example, given `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5`, you should return `1 -> 3 -> 2 -> 5 -> 4`.

On election day, a voting machine writes data in the form `(voter_id, candidate_id)` to a text file. Write a program that reads this file as a stream and returns the top `3` candidates at any given time. If you find a voter voting more than once, report this as fraud.

Create an algorithm to efficiently compute the approximate median of a list of numbers.

More precisely, given an unordered list of `N` numbers, find an element whose rank is between `N / 4` and `3 * N / 4`, with a high level of certainty, in less than `O(N)` time.

Given a string, find the palindrome that can be made by inserting the fewest number of characters as possible anywhere in the word. If there is more than one palindrome of minimum length that can be made, return the lexicographically earliest one (the first one alphabetically).

For example, given the string "race", you should return "ecarace", since we can add three letters to it (which is the smallest amount to make a palindrome). There are seven other palindromes that can be made from "race" by adding three letters, but "ecarace" comes first alphabetically.

As another example, given the string "google", you should return "elgoogle".

Given a list of words, find all pairs of unique indices such that the concatenation of the two words is a palindrome.

For example, given the list `["code", "edoc", "da", "d"]`, return `[(0, 1), (1, 0), (2, 3)]`.

You are given an array of integers, where each element represents the maximum number of steps that can be jumped going forward from that element. Write a function to return the minimum number of jumps you must take in order to get from the start to the end of the array.

For example, given `[6, 2, 4, 0, 5, 1, 1, 4, 2, 9]`, you should return `2`, as the optimal solution involves jumping from `6` to `5`, and then from `5` to `9`.

You are given an array of nonnegative integers. Let's say you start at the beginning of the array and are trying to advance to the end. You can advance at most, the number of steps that you're currently on. Determine whether you can get to the end of the array.

For example, given the array `[1, 3, 1, 2, 0, 1]`, we can go from indices `0 -> 1 -> 3 -> 5`, so return `true`.

Given the array `[1, 2, 1, 0, 0]`, we can't reach the end, so return `false`.

Given a list of integers and a number K, return which contiguous elements of the list sum to K.

For example, if the list is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and K is 9, then it should return [2, 3, 4], since 2 + 3 + 4 = 9.

Given an unsorted array of integers, find the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.

For example, given `[100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]`, the longest consecutive element sequence is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. Return its length: `4`.

Your algorithm should run in `O(n)` complexity.

Given a linked list of numbers and a pivot `k`, partition the linked list so that all nodes less than `k` come before nodes greater than or equal to `k`.

For example, given the linked list `5 -> 1 -> 8 -> 0 -> 3` and `k = 3`, the solution could be `1 -> 0 -> 5 -> 8 -> 3`.

Let's define a "sevenish" number to be one which is either a power of `7`, or the sum of unique powers of `7`. The first few sevenish numbers are `1`, `7`, `8`, `49`, and so on. Create an algorithm to find the `n`th sevenish number.

This problem was asked by Google.

Given two singly linked lists that intersect at some point, find the intersecting node. The lists are non-cyclical.

For example, given A = 3 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 and B = 99 -> 1 -> 8 -> 10, return the node with value 8.

In this example, assume nodes with the same value are the exact same node objects.

Do this in O(M + N) time (where M and N are the lengths of the lists) and constant space.

Given an array of numbers and a number `k`, determine if there are three entries in the array which add up to the specified number `k`. For example, given `[20, 303, 3, 4, 25]` and `k = 49`, return `true` as `20 + 4 + 25 = 49`.

You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form `(lr)`, where `l` corresponds to the left child and `r` corresponds to the right child.

If either `l` or `r` is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new `(lr)` pair.

Here are a few examples:

- A root node with no children: `(00)`
- A root node with two children: `((00)(00))`
- An unbalanced tree with three consecutive left children: `((((00)0)0)0)`

Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

Given a string and a number of lines `k`, print the string in zigzag form. In zigzag, characters are printed out diagonally from top left to bottom right until reaching the `k``th` line, then back up to top right, and so on.

For example, given the sentence `"thisisazigzag"` and `k = 4`, you should print:

```
t     a     g
 h   s z   a
  i i   i z
   s     g
```

Given an array of numbers, find the maximum sum of any contiguous subarray of the array.

For example, given the array [34, -50, 42, 14, -5, 86], the maximum sum would be 137, since we would take elements 42, 14, -5, and 86.

Given the array [-5, -1, -8, -9], the maximum sum would be 0, since we would not take any elements.

Do this in O(N) time.
