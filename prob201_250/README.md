You are given an array of arrays of integers, where each array corresponds to a row in a triangle of numbers. For example, `[[1], [2, 3], [1, 5, 1]]` represents the triangle:

```
  1
 2 3
1 5 1
```

We define a path in the triangle to start at the top and go down one row at a time to an adjacent value, eventually ending with an entry on the bottom row. For example, 1 -> 3 -> 5. The weight of the path is the sum of the entries.

Write a program that returns the weight of the maximum weight path.

A permutation can be specified by an array `P`, where `P[i]` represents the location of the element at `i` in the permutation. For example, `[2, 1, 0]` represents the permutation where elements at the index `0` and `2` are swapped.

Given an array and a permutation, apply the permutation to the array. For example, given the array `["a", "b", "c"]` and the permutation `[2, 1, 0]`, return `["c", "b", "a"]`.

A Collatz sequence in mathematics can be defined as follows. Starting with any positive integer:

- if n is even, the next number in the sequence is n / 2
- if n is odd, the next number in the sequence is 3n + 1

It is conjectured that every such sequence eventually reaches the number `1`. Test this conjecture.

The horizontal distance of a binary tree node describes how far left or right the node will be when the tree is printed out.

More rigorously, we can define it as follows:

- The horizontal distance of the root is 0.
- The horizontal distance of a left child is `hd(parent) - 1`.
- The horizontal distance of a right child is `hd(parent) + 1`.

For example, for the following tree, `hd(1) = -2`, and `hd(6) = 0`.

```
             5
          /     \
        3         7
      /  \      /   \
    1     4    6     9
   /                /
  0                8
```

The bottom view of a tree, then, consists of the lowest node at each horizontal distance. If there are two nodes at the same depth and horizontal distance, either is acceptable.

For this tree, for example, the bottom view could be `[0, 1, 3, 6, 8, 9]`.

Given the root to a binary tree, return its bottom view.

There are `N` prisoners standing in a circle, waiting to be executed. The executions are carried out starting with the `k`th person, and removing every successive `k`th person going clockwise until there is no one left.

Given `N` and `k`, write an algorithm to determine where a prisoner should stand in order to be the last survivor.

For example, if `N = 5` and `k = 2`, the order of executions would be `[2, 4, 1, 5, 3]`, so you should return `3`.

Bonus: Find an `O(log N)` solution if `k = 2`.

[Snakes and Ladders](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders) is a game played on a `10 x 10` board, the goal of which is get from square `1` to square `100`.  On each turn players will roll a six-sided die and move forward a  number of spaces equal to the result. If they land on a square that  represents a snake or ladder, they will be transported ahead or behind,  respectively, to a new square.

Find the smallest number of turns it takes to play snakes and ladders.

You are given `N` identical eggs and access to a building with `k`  floors. Your task is to find the lowest floor that will cause an egg to  break, if dropped from that floor. Once an egg breaks, it cannot be  dropped again. If an egg breaks when dropped from the `x``th` floor, you can assume it will also break when dropped from any floor greater than `x`.

Write an algorithm that finds the minimum number of trial drops it will take, in the worst case, to identify this floor.

For example, if `N = 1` and `k = 5`,  we will need to try dropping the egg at every floor, beginning with the  first, until we reach the fifth floor, so our solution will be `5`.

[Blackjack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) is a two player card game whose rules are as follows:

- The player and then the dealer are each given two cards.
- The player can then "hit", or ask for arbitrarily many additional cards, so long as their total does not exceed `21`.
- The dealer must then hit if their total is `16` or lower, otherwise pass.
- Finally, the two compare totals, and the one with the greatest sum not exceeding `21` is the winner.

For this problem, cards values are counted as follows: each card between `2` and `10` counts as their face value, face cards count as `10`, and aces count as `1`.

Given perfect knowledge of the sequence of cards in the deck, implement a blackjack solver that maximizes the player's score (that is, wins minus losses).

One way to unlock an Android phone is through a pattern of swipes across a `1-9` keypad.

For a pattern to be valid, it must satisfy the following:

- All of its keys must be distinct.
- It must not connect two keys by jumping over a third key, unless that key has already been used.

For example, `4 - 2 - 1 - 7` is a valid pattern, whereas `2 - 1 - 7` is not.

In academia, the h-index is a metric used to calculate the impact of a researcher's papers. It is calculated as follows:

A researcher has index `h` if at least `h` of her `N` papers have `h` citations each. If there are multiple `h` satisfying this formula, the maximum is chosen.

For example, suppose `N` = 5, and the respective citations of each paper are `[4, 3, 0, 1, 5]`. Then the h-index would be `3`, since the researcher has `3` papers with at least `3` citations.

Given a list of paper citations of a researcher, calculate their h-index.
