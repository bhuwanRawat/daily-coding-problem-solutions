Implement a data structure which carries out the following operations without resizing the underlying array:

- `add(value)`: Add a value to the set of values.
- `check(value)`: Check whether a value is in the set.

The `check` method may return occasional false positives (in other words, incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but should always correctly identify a true element.

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `/`, `\`, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:

```
\    /
 \  /
  \/
```

Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return `3`.

A knight is placed on a given square on an `8 x 8` chessboard. It is then moved randomly several times, where each move is a standard [knight move](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knight_(chess)#Movement). If the knight jumps off the board at any point, however, it is not allowed to jump back on.

After `k` moves, what is the probability that the knight remains on the board?
