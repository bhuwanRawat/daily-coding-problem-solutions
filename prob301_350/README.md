Implement a data structure which carries out the following operations without resizing the underlying array:

- `add(value)`: Add a value to the set of values.
- `check(value)`: Check whether a value is in the set.

The `check` method may return occasional false positives (in other words, incorrectly identifying an element as part of the set), but should always correctly identify a true element.

You are given a 2-d matrix where each cell consists of either `/`, `\`, or an empty space. Write an algorithm that determines into how many regions the slashes divide the space.

For example, suppose the input for a three-by-six grid is the following:

```
\    /
 \  /
  \/
```

Considering the edges of the matrix as boundaries, this divides the grid into three triangles, so you should return `3`.

This problem was asked by Quantcast.

You are presented with an array representing a Boolean expression. The elements are of two kinds:

- `T` and `F`, representing the values `True` and `False`.
- `&`, `|`, and `^`, representing the bitwise operators for `AND`, `OR`, and `XOR`.

Determine the number of ways to group the array elements using parentheses so that the entire expression evaluates to `True`.

For example, suppose the input is `['F', '|', 'T', '&', 'T']`. In this case, there are two acceptable groupings: `(F | T) & T` and `F | (T & T)`.

This problem was asked by Walmart Labs.

There are `M` people sitting in a row of `N` seats, where `M < N`. Your task is to redistribute people such that there are no gaps between any of them, while keeping overall movement to a minimum.

For example, suppose you are faced with an input of `[0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]`, where `0` represents an empty seat and `1` represents a person. In this case, one solution would be to place the person on the right in the fourth seat. We can consider the cost of a solution to be the sum of the absolute distance each person must move, so that the cost here would be five.

Given an input such as the one above, return the lowest possible cost of moving people to remove all gaps.

You are given a `2 x N` board, and instructed to completely cover the board with the following shapes:

- Dominoes, or `2 x 1` rectangles.
- Trominoes, or `L`-shapes.

For example, if `N = 4`, here is one possible configuration, where `A`is a domino, and `B` and `C` are trominoes.

This problem was asked by Citrix.

You are given a circular lock with three wheels, each of which display the numbers `0` through `9` in order. Each of these wheels rotate clockwise and counterclockwise.

In addition, the lock has a certain number of "dead ends", meaning that if you turn the wheels to one of these combinations, the lock becomes stuck in that state and cannot be opened.

Let us consider a "move" to be a rotation of a single wheel by one digit, in either direction. Given a lock initially set to `000`, a target combination, and a list of dead ends, write a function that returns the minimum number of moves required to reach the target state, or `None`if this is impossible.

This problem was asked by Spotify.

You are the technical director of WSPT radio, serving listeners nationwide. For simplicity's sake we can consider each listener to live along a horizontal line stretching from `0` (west) to `1000` (east).

Given a list of `N` listeners, and a list of `M` radio towers, each placed at various locations along this line, determine what the minimum broadcast range would have to be in order for each listener's home to be covered.

For example, suppose `listeners = [1, 5, 11, 20]`, and `towers = [4, 8, 15]`. In this case the minimum range would be `5`, since that would be required for the tower at position `15` to reach the listener at position `20`.

This problem was asked by PagerDuty.

Given a positive integer `N`, find the smallest number of steps it will take to reach `1`.

There are two kinds of permitted steps:

- You may decrement `N` to `N - 1`.
- If `a * b = N`, you may decrement `N` to the larger of `a` and `b`.

For example, given `100`, you can reach `1` in five steps with the following route: `100 -> 10 -> 9 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1`.

This problem was asked by Amazon.

Consider the following scenario: there are `N` mice and `N` holes placed at integer points along a line. Given this, find a method that maps mice to holes such that the largest number of steps any mouse takes is minimized.

Each move consists of moving one mouse one unit to the left or right, and only one mouse can fit inside each hole.

For example, suppose the mice are positioned at `[1, 4, 9, 15]`, and the holes are located at `[10, -5, 0, 16]`. In this case, the best pairing would require us to send the mouse at `1` to the hole at `-5`, so our function should return `6`.

The United States uses the imperial system of weights and measures, which means that there are many different, seemingly arbitrary units to measure distance. There are 12 inches in a foot, 3 feet in a yard, 22 yards in a chain, [and so on](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperial_units#Length).

Create a data structure that can efficiently convert a certain quantity of one unit to the correct amount of any other unit. You should also allow for additional units to be added to the system.

A Cartesian tree with sequence `S` is a binary tree defined by the following two properties:

- It is heap-ordered, so that each parent value is strictly less than that of its children.
- An in-order traversal of the tree produces nodes with values that correspond exactly to `S`.

For example, given the sequence `[3, 2, 6, 1, 9]`, the resulting Cartesian tree would be:

```
      1
    /   \   
  2       9
 / \
3   6
```

Given a sequence `S`, construct the corresponding Cartesian tree.

In chess, the Elo rating system is used to calculate player strengths based on game results.

A simplified description of the Elo system is as follows. Every player begins at the same score. For each subsequent game, the loser transfers some points to the winner, where the amount of points transferred depends on how unlikely the win is. For example, a 1200-ranked player should gain much more points for beating a 2000-ranked player than for beating a 1300-ranked player.

Implement this system.

The [stable marriage problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) is defined as follows:

Suppose you have `N` men and `N` women, and each person has ranked their prospective opposite-sex partners in order of preference.

For example, if `N = 3`, the input could be something like this:

```python
guy_preferences = {
    'andrew': ['caroline', 'abigail', 'betty'],
    'bill': ['caroline', 'betty', 'abigail'],
    'chester': ['betty', 'caroline', 'abigail'],

    'abigail': ['andrew', 'bill', 'chester'],
    'betty': ['bill', 'andrew', 'chester'],
    'caroline': ['bill', 'chester', 'andrew']
}
```

Write an algorithm that pairs the men and women together in such a way that no two people of opposite sex would both rather be with each other than with their current partners.

A Boolean formula can be said to be satisfiable if there is a way to assign truth values to each variable such that the entire formula evaluates to true.

For example, suppose we have the following formula, where the symbol `¬` is used to denote negation:

```
(¬c OR b) AND (b OR c) AND (¬b OR c) AND (¬c OR ¬a)
```

One way to satisfy this formula would be to let `a = False`, `b = True`, and `c = True`.

This type of formula, with `AND` statements joining tuples containing exactly one `OR`, is known as `2-CNF`.

Given a `2-CNF` formula, find a way to assign truth values to satisfy it, or return `False` if this is impossible.

PageRank is an algorithm used by Google to rank the importance of different websites. While there have been changes over the years, the central idea is to assign each site a score based on the importance of other pages that link to that page.

More mathematically, suppose there are `N` sites, and each site `i` has a certain count `C``i` of outgoing links. Then the score for a particular site `S``j` is defined as :

```
score(Sj) = (1 - d) / N + d * (score(Sx) / Cx+ score(Sy) / Cy+ ... + score(Sz) / Cz))
```

Here, `S``x`, `S``y`, `...`, `S``z` denote the scores of all the other sites that have outgoing links to `S``j`, and `d` is a damping factor, usually set to around `0.85`, used to model the probability that a user will stop searching.

Given a directed graph of links between various websites, write a program that calculates each site's page rank.
