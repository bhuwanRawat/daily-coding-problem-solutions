Word sense disambiguation is the problem of determining which sense a word takes on in a particular setting, if that word has multiple meanings. For example, in the sentence "I went to get money from the *bank*", bank probably means the place where people deposit money, not the land beside a river or lake.

Suppose you are given a list of meanings for several words, formatted like so:

```python
{
    "word_1": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...],
    ...
    "word_n": ["meaning one", "meaning two", ...]
}
```

Given a sentence, most of whose words are contained in the meaning list above, create an algorithm that determines the likely sense of each possibly ambiguous word.

A typical American-style crossword puzzle grid is an `N x N` matrix with black and white squares, which obeys the following rules:

- Every white square must be part of an "across" word and a "down" word.
- No word can be fewer than three letters long.
- Every white square must be reachable from every other white square.
- The grid is rotationally symmetric (for example, the colors of the top left and bottom right squares must match).

Write a program to determine whether a given matrix qualifies as a crossword grid.

You are given a histogram consisting of rectangles of different heights. These heights are represented in an input list, such that `[1, 3, 2, 5]` corresponds to the following diagram:

```
      x
      x  
  x   x
  x x x
x x x x
```

Determine the area of the largest rectangle that can be formed only from the bars of the histogram. For the diagram above, for example, this would be six, representing the `2 x 3` area at the bottom right.

Design a system to crawl and copy all of Wikipedia using a distributed network of machines.

More specifically, suppose your server has access to a set of client machines. Your client machines can execute code you have written to access Wikipedia pages, download and parse their data, and write the results to a database.

Some questions you may want to consider as part of your solution are:

- How will you reach as many pages as possible?
- How can you keep track of pages that have already been visited?
- How will you deal with your client machines being blacklisted?
- How can you update your database when Wikipedia pages are added or updated?

You are given an array `X` of floating-point numbers `x``1`, `x``2`, ... `x``n`. These can be rounded up or down to create a corresponding array `Y` of integers `y``1`, `y``2`, ... `y``n`.

Write an algorithm that finds an appropriate `Y` array with the following properties:

- The rounded sums of both arrays should be equal.
- The absolute pairwise difference between elements is minimized. In other words, `|x``1``- y``1``| + |x``2``- y``2``| + ... + |x``n``- y``n``|`should be as small as possible.

For example, suppose your input is `[1.3, 2.3, 4.4]`. In this case you cannot do better than `[1, 2, 5]`, which has an absolute difference of `|1.3 - 1| + |2.3 - 2| + |4.4 - 5| = 1`.

Implement a queue using a set of fixed-length arrays.

The queue should support `enqueue`, `dequeue`, and `get_size`operations.

You are given a binary tree in a peculiar string representation. Each node is written in the form `(lr)`, where `l` corresponds to the left child and `r` corresponds to the right child.

If either `l` or `r` is null, it will be represented as a zero. Otherwise, it will be represented by a new `(lr)` pair.

Here are a few examples:

- A root node with no children: `(00)`
- A root node with two children: `((00)(00))`
- An unbalanced tree with three consecutive left children: `((((00)0)0)0)`

Given this representation, determine the depth of the tree.

Create a data structure that performs all the following operations in `O(1)` time:

- `plus`: Add a key with value `1`. If the key already exists, increment its value by one.
- `minus`: Decrement the value of a key. If the key's value is currently `1`, remove it.
- `get_max`: Return a key with the highest value.
- `get_min`: Return a key with the lowest value.
